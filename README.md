## 1. CPU Monitoring

Monitoring CPU load and usage helps identify if the CPU is overburdened, which can impact system performance.

### Key Commands

- **CPU Load Averages**:
  ```bash
  uptime
  ```

- **Detailed CPU Usage**:
  ```bash
  top -bn1 | grep "Cpu(s)"
  ```

- **Load Average Over Time**:
  ```bash
  cat /proc/loadavg
  ```

- **Command Breakdown**:
  - **`top`**: Displays real-time CPU and process information.
  - **`uptime`**: Shows system uptime and load averages for the last 1, 5, and 15 minutes.
  - **`/proc/loadavg`**: Provides system load averages directly from the kernel.

### Script to Monitor CPU Usage

```bash
#!/bin/bash
CPU_LOAD=$(top -bn1 | grep "load average" | awk '{printf "Load Average: %s, %s, %s\n", $10, $11, $12}')
CPU_IDLE=$(top -bn1 | grep "Cpu(s)" | awk '{print $8}' | cut -d'%' -f1)
CPU_USAGE=$(echo "100 - $CPU_IDLE" | bc)
echo "CPU Load: $CPU_LOAD"
echo "CPU Usage: $CPU_USAGE%"
```

## 2. Memory Monitoring

Monitoring memory usage helps prevent system slowdowns and crashes due to memory exhaustion.

### Key Commands

- **Memory Usage Summary**:
  ```bash
  free -h
  ```

- **Detailed Memory Usage**:
  ```bash
  vmstat -s
  ```

- **Memory Usage by Process**:
  ```bash
  ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -n 10
  ```

### Explanation
- **`free -h`**: Displays total, used, and available memory in a human-readable format.
- **`vmstat -s`**: Shows a detailed breakdown of memory usage statistics.
- **`ps aux --sort=-%mem`**: Lists processes sorted by memory usage (highest first).

---

## 3. Disk Usage Monitoring

Disk usage monitoring is essential to avoid running out of disk space, which can halt system processes.

### Key Commands

- **Disk Usage Summary**:
  ```bash
  df -h
  ```

- **Disk Space per Directory**:
  ```bash
  du -sh /path/to/directory/*
  ```

- **Inode Usage**:
  ```bash
  df -i
  ```

### Explanation
- **`df -h`**: Displays disk space usage of mounted filesystems in human-readable format.
- **`du -sh`**: Shows disk usage for each subdirectory, helpful for identifying large folders.
- **`df -i`**: Checks inode usage, which can affect systems with many small files.

---

## 4. Network Monitoring

Network monitoring helps ensure sufficient bandwidth and troubleshoot network bottlenecks.

### Key Commands

- **Network Statistics**:
  ```bash
  ifconfig
  ```

- **Network Connections**:
  ```bash
  netstat -tuln
  ```

- **Network Bandwidth**:
  ```bash
  nload
  ```

### Explanation
- **`ifconfig`**: Displays network interface configurations.
- **`netstat -tuln`**: Lists all active network connections and listening ports.
- **`nload`**: Real-time monitoring of network traffic (install with `sudo apt install nload`).

---

## 5. System Logs

Logs are crucial for diagnosing issues and identifying security events on the system.

### Key Commands

- **System Logs**:
  ```bash
  tail -f /var/log/syslog
  ```

- **Kernel Logs**:
  ```bash
  dmesg | less
  ```

- **User Login Logs**:
  ```bash
  last
  ```

### Explanation
- **`tail -f /var/log/syslog`**: Monitors system log updates in real-time.
- **`dmesg`**: Shows kernel log messages, useful for hardware and boot-related issues.
- **`last`**: Displays recent user logins, useful for security audits.

## 6. Automated Monitoring Tools

To simplify and automate monitoring, you can use various tools that provide comprehensive dashboards and alerts.

### Popular Monitoring Tools

- **Nagios**: A widely-used, open-source monitoring tool with extensive plugins for monitoring services.
- **Prometheus + Grafana**: Prometheus collects metrics, while Grafana visualizes them in customizable dashboards.
- **Netdata**: Real-time performance monitoring with easy-to-understand graphical outputs.

Each tool has specific installation and configuration steps, but most provide advanced monitoring capabilities, including alerting and historical data visualization.

## Conclusion

Regular system monitoring is vital for maintaining system health and performance. By using these commands and tools, you can identify and resolve potential issues before they affect system functionality. For large-scale environments, consider using automated monitoring tools to streamline the monitoring process.
